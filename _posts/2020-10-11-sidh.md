Stolbunov proposed a Diffie-Hellman type system based on the difficulty of computing isogenies between *ordinary* (defined below) elliptic curves,with the aim of obtaining quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols. The fastest known classical probabilitic algorithm for solving this problem is an algorithm of Galbraith and Stolbunov (), which is exponential with a worst-case running time of $O(^4\sqrt{q})$. However, on a quantum computer, recent work of Childs et al. () has shown that the private keys in Stolbunov's system can be recovered in subexponential time. 

Another issue is efficieny: even if we only consider classical attacks in assessing security levels, Stolbunov's scheme requires 229 seconds (even with precomputation) to perform a single key exchange operation at the 128-bit security level on a desktop computer.

In 2011, Luca De Feo, David Jao and Jérôme Plût published a paper entitled 'Towards Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystems from Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogenies', which presented isogeny-based key-exchange, encryption and  identification schemes that address both the performance and security drawbacks of Stolbunov's system.  They coined their key-exchange protocol SIDH, for Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman.

Throughout this we will assume that we are working over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$.

## Supersingular vs. Ordinary

There are two types of elliptic curves that we can have are **ordinary** or **supersingular**. The precise definitions are unimportant for cryptographic purposes, however it is usefult to note that supersingular curves are all defined over $\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}$, so for the finite field we're working over, we can take $q = p^2$. 


If we have two elliptic curves $E_1$ and $E_2$ such that there exists an isogeny $\phi$ connecting them, then we say that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are in the same **isogeny class**. 

**FACT:** Ellitpic curves in the same isogeny class are either all supersingular or all ordinary. 

In SIDH we will be going from one ellitpic curve, say $E$ , to another via an isogeny (or a composition of various isogenies). The fact above tells us that if we start with a supersingular curve, we will end up at another supersingular curve. This is a highly desirable property as it means we don't have to make any restrictions on the isogenies we choose from $E$ to ensure we end up at a supersingular curve. 

## Non-Commutative

The main technical difficulty is that, in the supersingular case, the endomorphism ring is noncommutative, whereas Diffie-Hellman type protocols require commutativity. In the paper, they propose overcoming this obstacle by providing the outputs of the isogeny on certain points as auxiliary input to the protocols. Provided this auxiliary input does not make the problem of finding isogenies any easier, the added difficulty arising from the anticommutativity actually makes the protocol stronger. 

Before analysing the security of the scheme in greater detail, we describe how to get public-key cryptosystems based on supersingular curves
