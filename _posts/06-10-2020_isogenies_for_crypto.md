On July 22, 2020, the [Round 3 NIST finalists][https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions] for their Post-quantum Cryptograph Standardization effort were announced. One of the alternate candidates for public-key encryption and key-establishement algorithms is **SIKE**, a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on *isogenies*. A non-specialist wanting a basic understanding of the schemes may find that SIKE protocol has one of the highest barriers of entry due to the sheer amount of mathematical background you need to understand before getting to the cryptography part. This post is aimed at providing a *hopefully* short introduction to isogenies and how they can be used for cryptography. 

Assumed knowledge:
* Elliptic Curves (over Finite Fields)
* 

##Isogenies - Basics

Let \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) be elliptic curves defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$
