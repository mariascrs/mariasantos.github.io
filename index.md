Originally from Portugal, I completed my Undergraduate and Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Algebraic Number Theory and Elliptic Curves. 

I am now a first year PhD student, part of the [CDT for Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/) and the [Information Security group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London. My main interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based protocols and applications.
