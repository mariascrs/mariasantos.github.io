I am currently a second year PhD student, part of the [CDT for Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cybersecurity-cdt/) and the [Information Security group](https://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London. My main interests are post-quantum cryptography, specifically isogeny-based protocols and applications.
My main supervisors are [Philipp Jovanovic](https://philipp.jovanovic.io/) and [Sarah Meiklejohn](https://smeiklej.com/).

Before starting my PhD I completed my Undergraduate and Master's degree in Mathematics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/), specialising in Algebraic Number Theory and Elliptic Curves.
